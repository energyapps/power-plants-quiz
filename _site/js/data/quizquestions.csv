Black Liquor is a by-product of paper production, known for its black color. Many paper pulp mills are located in the South, leading to the concentration of Black Liquor plants there."3,"This fossil fuel is used all over the Midwest, Hawaii and Alaska",Petroleum Products,Coal,Blast Furnace Gas,Kerosene,img/petroleum.png,"Petroleum has the fourth highest installed capacity, after Natural Gas, Coal, and Hydroelectricity. Why so low? Though we use more petroleum than natural gas overall, much of this usage is in our cars and trucks."4,You can find this fuel source in some awfully sunny places.,Geothermal Power,Jet Fuel,Hydroelectric Power,Solar Power,img/geo.png,"Fooled you! While it happens that geothermal power occurs in some sunny, warm places, all of these locations have geothermal activity near the surface."5,What's going on in Western Alaska?,Jet Fuel,Wind Power,Sludge Waste,Agricultural By-Products,img/jf.png,"If you are anything like me, you keep hoping that the answer is Sludge Waste, but its not. Jet Fuel can actually be used for electricity generation, often times in ""peaking power plants"" which are only operated when there is peak demand due to how expensive it is to run them."6,This fuel source is captured as a by-product of another large scale process.,Landfill Gas,Sludge Waste,Black Liquor,Agricultural By-Products,img/lfg.png,"While each of these options is a by-product or waste product of natural or industrial processes, the location of these plants are clearly near highly populated places, where we find landfills."7,"Very few of these power plants exist on the West Coast, but they tend to have very high generation capacity per power plant",Nuclear Power,Natural Gas,Coal,Wood Waste Liquids,img/nuc.png,The last Nuclear Power Plant came online in 1996.8,Which fuel source seems like a it stretches all the way down the Appalachian Mountains?,Coal,Wind Power,Solar Power,Hydroelectric Power,img/coal.png,The Appalachian Mountains are often visited by Elves each year prior to December.9,"Seems like Massachusetts, New Jersey, and North Carolina are in love with this, but don't let that fact deceive you.",Solar Power,Wood Waste Liquids,Hydroelectric Power,Wind Power,img/sun.png,"Utility scale solar power is growing all over the country, as installation costs continue to plummet."10,This is the leading renewable energy source in capacity and number of generators.,Hydroelectric Power,Geothermal Power,Agricultural By-Products,Wind Power,img/wat.png,"The oldest continually operated electricity generator in the country is a hydroelectric facility in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. It came online in 1891."11,"This fuel source has grown like gang-busters in the last few years, particularly in Iowa, Texas, and Oklahoma.",Wind Power,Petroleum Products,Sludge Waste,Subbituminous Coal,img/wnd.png,"We're blown away by Wind Power's growth recently, though in the Southern US, there isn't much wind, and therefore not much development."
